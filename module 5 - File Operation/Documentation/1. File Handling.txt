File Handling

	Go offers excellent support to perform file-related operations, such as creating a file, read/write operations, file rename or move, copy, getting metadata information of the file, and so forth.
The os package provides an API interface for file handling which is uniform across all operating systems. Although the design follows Unix standards, it provides a platform-independent interface to any operating system functionality.

	The packages such as io, ioutil and bufio provide interfaces for I/O operations such as read and write operations on the content of the file.

1. File Creation

	We use the Create() method for this from os package.

We can do file operations like Rename, Move, Delete, Open , Close , Check permissions of file using os package.

2.Get File Information
	
	We use Stat() method from os package to get metadata of file.

3. File Reading & Opening Operations:

	We can use Open() or OpenFile() method of os package to read from a file.

	Difference of Open () and OpenFile() method is s follow:
		Open() : Opens files in ReadOnly mode only.
		OpenFile() : We can select files in multiple modes and perform many operations on the file. We will see this example in write operation.

	There is also bufio package we can use for file operations. 

	Buffered reader will store a memory buffer with some of the contents. A buffered reader also provides some more functions that are not available on the os.File type or the io.Reader

Arrays

The type  [n]T is an array of n values of type T.

	var a [10]int

declares a variable a as an array of 10 integers.

An arrays length is part of its type, so array cannot be resized. This seems limiting but don't worry, Go provides a convenient way  of working with arrays.

The builtin len() returns the length of an array.

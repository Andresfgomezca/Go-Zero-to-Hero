Variables and constants

	In Go, variables are explicitly declared and used by the compiler. variable can be of type local and global.
		
		-The keyword var can be used to declare the variable.

		-Go provides flexibility that, we can ignore the type of variable if you are assigning the value to it, Go compiler automatically detect the type of assignment value and create the variable of that type

Short Variable Declaration
	
	Inside a function, the := short assignment statement can be used in place of a var declaration with implicit type. Outside a function, every statement begins with a keyword (var, func, and so on) and so the := construct is not available.

Constant

	Go supports constants of character, string, boolean and numeric values. constant can be declared similar to variable additionally we need const keyword with it. as like other languages constant value doesn't change throughout the code and assignment of value is required while declaration if the constant.

If Else

	Branching with if else is very common and straight-forward in Go. As like other languages we can have if without else, else if ladder as well as if and else blocks.

	simple example of if else statement:

if 5%2 == 0 {
   fmt.Println("5 is even")
} else {
    fmt.Println("5 is odd")
}

	Note that you don't need parentheses around the if condition in Go, but those curly braces {} are required, even for single statement in the if else block.

	Note:  There is no ternary operator available in the Go, so we need to use if statements in case of basic conditions.

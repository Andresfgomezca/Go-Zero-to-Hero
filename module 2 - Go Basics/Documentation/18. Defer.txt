Defer

	A defer statement defers the execution of a function until the surrounding function returns.

	The deferred call's arguments are evaluated immediately, but the function call is not executed until the surrounding function returns.

For Example

package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	defer fmt.Println("World!")

	fmt.Println("Hello")
}

	Prints the "Hello World!" on the console.

	Defer is used to ensure that a function call is performed later in a program's execution, usually the purpose of the defer is to perform cleanup task. defer is similar to finally block in the other languages.

	e.g. Suppose we wanted to write some content into the file then we have open the file and on successful file opening we will defer the close activity for the file. so that defer insures that, once the writing into file gets finished it will close the file with deferred function.

For Loop 

	for is the Go's only loop. Unlike other languages like C and Java we don't have while and do-while loop but we can achieve the behaviour of those loops using the for loop.

	A classic example of for loop is:
for j := 1; j <= 5; j++ {
        fmt.Println(j)
    }

	While loop using for loop:
i := 1
for i <= 3 {
    fmt.Println(i)
    i = i + 1
}

	Infinite for loop:
for {
    fmt.Println("loop")
}
 

	There are other forms of loop are available which basically work on collections, channels and other data types called range. we will explore them in next section.

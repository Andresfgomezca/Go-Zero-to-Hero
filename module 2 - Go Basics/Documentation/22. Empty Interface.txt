Empty Interface

	The interface type that specifies zero methods is known as the empty interface:

		interface{}

	An empty interface may hold values of any type as every type implements at least zero methods.

	Empty interfaces are used by code that handles values of unknown type. For example fmt.Println() takes any number fo arguments of type interface{}

	As of now there is no support for generics in the Go, but with the help of empty interface (interface{}) we can achieve the behaviour of the generics.

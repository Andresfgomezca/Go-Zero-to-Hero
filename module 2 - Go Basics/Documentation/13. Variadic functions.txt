Variadic Functions

	Variadic functions can be called with any number of trailing arguments. For example, fmt.Println() is a common variadic function. This feature is similar to the var agrs in Java.

func sum(nums ...int) {
    fmt.Print(nums, " ")
    total := 0
    for _, num := range nums {
        total += num
    }
    fmt.Println(total)
}

	The above function sum() takes any number of integer parameters and calculate the sum.  we can use range operator to iterate those variadic parameters.

	If you have already multiple args in a slice, apply them to a variadic function using func(slice ...) like this.

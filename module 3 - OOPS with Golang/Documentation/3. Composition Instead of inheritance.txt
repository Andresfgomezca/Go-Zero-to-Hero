Composition Instead of Inheritance

	Go does not support inheritance, it does support composition

	Composition- The generic definition of composition is "put together". One example of composition is a car. A car is composed of wheels, an engine and various other parts.

	Composition can be achieved in Go by embedding one struct type into another.

Code Example

	A blog post is a perfect example of composition. Each blog post has a title, content and author information. This can be perfectly represented using composition.

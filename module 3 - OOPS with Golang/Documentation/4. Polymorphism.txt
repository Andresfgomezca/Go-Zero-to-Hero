Polymorphism

	Polymorphism is the ability to write code that can take on different behaviour through the implementation of types.

	Polymorphism in Go is achieved with the help of interfaces

	Any type which provides definition for all the methods of an interface is said to implicitly implement that interface.

	A variable of type interface can hold any value which implements the interface.This property of interfaces is used to achieve polymorphism in Go.
